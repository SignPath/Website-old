<h1 id="ca-security-council-best-practices-for-code-signing">CA Security Council best practices for code signing</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://casecurity.org/">CA Security Council</a> is an organization of several Certification Authorities. One of its goals is to advance code signing practices in the industry. The CASC has released a <a href="https://casecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/CASC-Code-Signing.pdf">white paper</a> that contain several best practices for code signing.</p>
<p>This is good and valuable advice, and SignPath.io supports these recommendations. However, it can be quite difficult and expensive to set up and repeatedly execute a code signing process that meets these criteria. If you use SignPath, it will take care of these recommendations for you. (SignPath organization administrators will be able to opt out of some security practices.)</p>
<p>This page outlines how SignPath ensures that these recommendations are fulfilled.</p>

<p class="admonition-title"><img src="https://about.signpath.io/wp-content/uploads/images/../info.png" alt="Information"> Do a cost/benefit analysis</p>
<p>Buying multiple EV certificates can be costly. On the other hand, non-EV certificates will always start with zero SmartScreen reputation.</p>
<p>SignPath.io recommends that you consider buying separate certificates for major product lines, teams or customers. However, you can have a perfectly secure code signing process with a single release certificate.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="https://about.signpath.io/wp-content/uploads/images/../todo.png" alt="TODO"> <strong>This should be separate guidance</strong>
Since test-signing for pre-releases is usually checked less rigorously, it often makes sense to issue separate test certificates for different teams and deploy those certificates only on machines that belong to this team. This is especially true if you distribute test certificates to customers for installation on their test machines.</p>
<ul>
<li>This might have an adverse effect on security if you don't have good control over these test certificates.
<ul>
<li>Aim for automatic deployment and undeployment based on some directory (Windows <em>Group Policy Objects</em> are a good candidate).</li>
<li>It is more secure to have an in-house CA issue test certificates than to use self-signed certificates, because only a CA can revoke certificates in case of a security incident.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is no value in separating test certificates pre-release builds are generally deployed across the organization.</li>
</ul>

<tr>
<td>If code is found with a security flaw, then publishers may want to prompt a User Account Control dialogue box to appear when the code is installed in the future; this can be done by revoking the code signing certificate so a revoked prompt will occur</td>
<td>SignPath puts you in a good position in case you have to revoke a certificate: All signatures have a valid time stamp, so only signatures from <em>after</em> the revocation date will be invalid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>If the code with the security flaw was issued before more good code was issued, then revoking the certificate will impact the good code as well</td>
<td>SignPath lets you re-sign individual releases that were involuntary affected by revocations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Changing keys and certificates often will help to avoid this conflict</td>
<td>This is true, but it will only reduce the problem in some situations. If you discover a security flaw shortly after the incident, chances are that you will still be using the same key and certificate.</td>
