<p>The following table separates steps between two roles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Administrator</strong>: has control over your SignPath organization, but does not necessarily know how the development team works.</li>
<li><strong>Development</strong>: people who know the details of your development process, but don't necessarily have administrative privileges in SignPath.</li>

<h2 id="distribution-of-roles">Distribution of roles</h2>
<p>SignPath is designed to make sure that people in charge of security have full control over code signing. Therefore, it makes sense to assign the role of <em>organization administrator</em> to security persons, such as InfoSec officers. It is also possible to assign administrative privileges to people in the development team. This can be on a permanent basis, or only temporarily to speed up initial setup. You can go with a model where every change has to be implemented by a dedicated administrator, or you can decentralize administration and have InfoSec review change audit logs regularly. Use the model that works best for your organization.</p>
<p>If you aim for the highest security, we recommend assigning the administrator role only to InfoSec staff and have them working directly with the development teams.</p>
<h2 id="using-signpath">Using SignPath</h2>
<h3 id="signing-code">Signing code</h3>
<p>There are two ways for submitting signing requests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the Web application to submit artifacts for signing
<ul>
<li>Go to the application dashboard</li>
<li>Select a project and signing policy</li>
<li>Upload a file</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use the PowerShell module or call our API</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, you will receive e-mail notifications for your request and be able to monitor them in the Web application.</p>
<h3 id="approving-signing-requests">Approving signing requests</h3>
<p>For signing policies that require approval, each approver will receive an e-mail notification whenever an approval is requested. Approvers will also see signing request waiting for their approval in the application dashboard.</p>
<h3 id="administration">Administration</h3>
<p>Administrators will be notified about important events. They can also use the Web application to see a full activity audit for each entity, including users, certificates, projects, signing policies and signing requests.</p>
